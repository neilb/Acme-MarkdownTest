# NAME

Acme::MarkdownTest - test module to see how markdown is handled

# SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::MarkdownTest;
    ...

# DESCRIPTION

This is an empty module that I'm using to see how well
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
is supported for writing module documentation.

In this documentation I've tried to use most of the standard markdown
elements, to see how they come out in perldoc, metacpan, and elsewhere.

Then we have _italic_ and **bold** formatting.

Let's have a bulleted list:

 * first bullet
 * second bullet

And then a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

And then a code sample:

    # This is a comment
    if ($answer > 41 && $answer < 43) {
        print "hooray!\n";
    }

And an inline `code()` example.

The next line should produce a horizontal rule:
